# hack
This program was supposed to be a way to hack into my teachers by installing malicious code in `.bashrcr`, so if my teacher did a `sudo` command, it would log the password and user to some website I have access to.
This way I could retrieve the password and user, connect to ssh from another computer in the network and install a keylogger, so I can get her pronote password and change grades and everything lol.

Of course I never did it, but it was a pretty cool project overall, because it made me aknowledge the intelligence of hackers.
